# Testing-Projects
Public repository where I showcase my manual/automated testing efforts

Projects showcased will be separated into two different branches depending on the framework used. Coding for all three frameworks will be done through Visual Studio Code (v1.99.x)
- Playwright (v1.42.0) in Typescript
- pytest (v8.0.2) in Python
